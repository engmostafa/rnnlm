There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

You're going out with the guy.

There has to be something
wrong with him.

So does he have a hump
and a hairpiece?

Wait, does he eat chalk?

I don't want her to go through
what I did with Carl.

Okay, everybody relax.

This is not even a date.

It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

Sounds like a date to me.

I'm in high school,
in the cafeteria..

and I realize I'm totally naked.

I've had that dream.

Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

there.

- Instead of
- That's right!

Never had that one.

All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

And it turns out it's my mother.

Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

He says, "Hello,"
I want to kill myself.

You okay?

I feel like someone pulled my
intestine out of my mouth...

and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

Carol moved her stuff out today.

- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.

- I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy.

No, you don't.

To hell with her. She left me!

And you never knew she was a lesbian.

Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

She didn't know.
How should I know?

Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

Did I say that out loud?

Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

You're angry. You're hurting.

Can I tell you what
the answer is?

Strip joints!

See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

I just want to be married again.

And I just want a million dollars!

Rachel?

Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

...that you might be here and you are.

-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe..

...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

Sure!

You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

I was in this room with
all the presents...

This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

When all of a sudden I realize...

Sweet 'N Low?

I realized...

...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

And then I really freaked out,
when it hit me:

How much Barry looks like
Mr. Potato Head.

I always knew he looked
familiar, but. . . .

I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .

. . . ''Why am I doing this?''
and ''Who am I doing this for?''

I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

. . .but you're the only person
I know in the city.

Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

I guess he bought her
the pipe organ. . .

. . .and she's really not
happy about it.

Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

I'm sorry.

I just don't love him.

Well, it matters to me!

She should not be
wearing those pants.

I say push her down the stairs!

Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

Come on, Daddy, listen!

All my life, everyone's
always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''

''You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! ''

I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

What if I want to be a purse?

Or a hat?''

I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I--

It's a metaphor, Daddy!

You can see where he'd have trouble.

Look, Daddy, it's my life.

Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

Well, maybe that's my decision.

Well, maybe I don't need your money.

Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.

Just try to think
of nice, calm things.

Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

La la la something
And noodles with string

-These are a--
-I'm all better now.

I helped.

This is probably for
the best, you know?

Independence.
Taking control of your life.

If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

What? Like there's
a rule or something?

Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

It's Paul.

Buzz him in.

-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

Maybe.

Your ''not a real date,''
is with Paul, the wine guy?

He finally asked you out?

It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

Rach, I can cancel.

Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.

Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

That'd be good.

-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

Hi, come in! Paul, this is. . .

. . .everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.

I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

Rachel, what are you
up to tonight?

I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon. . .

. . .so, nothing.

Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

Although, Aruba. This time of year?
Talk about your. . .

. . .big lizards.

If you don't feel
like being alone tonight. . .

. . .Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

And we're very excited about it.

Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

-It's been a long day.
-Okay. Sure.

Pheebs, wanna help?

I wish I could, but I don't want to.

I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things. . .

. . .using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .

. . .and I cannot feel my legs.

-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

This was Carol's favorite beer.

She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

Let me ask you a question.

She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

What did you get?

You guys.

-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.

-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

I mean, how clean can teeth get?

My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

How did you get through it?

He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

-Say her--
-Leg?

That's one way of going through it.
Me, I went for the watch.

You actually broke her watch?

Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

It's about me.
And I just--

Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .

You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?

I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

What are you talking about?
One woman.

That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

Rocky road, and cookie dough,
and bing cherry vanilla.

You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.

This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

You got married. You were
like, what? Eight?

Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

Then stay out of my freezer.

Ever since she
walked out on me, I. . . .

What? What?

You wanna spell it out with noodles?

It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

So there's going to be a fifth date?

Isn't there?

Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

What were you going to say?

Ever since she left me. . .

. . .I haven't been able to perform. . .

. . .sexually.

Oh, God! Oh, God!

I'm so sorry.

Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

How long?

Two years.

I'm glad you smashed her watch.

So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

Yeah, I do.

But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

''Grab a spoon. ''

Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a
hero,'' mean anything to you?

You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough. . .

. . .to ask a woman out. . .

. . .who am I going to ask?

Isn't this amazing?

I have never made coffee
before in my life.

-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

If you feel like you gotta make
a Western omelet or something. . . .

Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

-Good morning.
-Good morning.

-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

Last night was like. . .

-Thank you so much.

We'll talk later.

Thank you.

That wasn't a real date.

What the hell do you do
on a real date?

Shut up and put my table back.

I've got to get to work.

If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

So, like, you guys all have jobs?

Yeah, we all have jobs.

That's how we buy stuff.

Yeah, I'm an actor.

Have I seen you in anything?

I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

Unless you happen to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio...

''Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy. ''

I will not take this abuse.

You're right. I'm sorry..

Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

How are you doing today?
You sleep okay?

Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

I know. He's just so--

Remember you and Tony De Marco?

Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

-Are you in trouble!

I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

Or else I'm just going
to get up and go to work.

-Wish me luck!
-What for?

I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

How was Florida?

You had sex, didn't you?

How do you do that?

So, who?

You know Paul?

Paul, the wine guy?

Yeah, I know Paul.

You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

Of course it was a line.

Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than. . .

. . . ''To get you into bed. ''

Is it me?

Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs. . .

. . .and men with emotional
problems can hear?

Come here.
Give me your feet.

I just thought he was
nice, you know?

I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

Guess what?

-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

I'm trained for nothing.

I was laughed out of 12 interviews.

You're surprisingly upbeat.

You would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale. . .

. . .50% percent off.

How well you know me.

They're my, ''I don't need
a job or my parents.

I've got great boots,'' boots.

-How did you pay for them?
-Credit card.

And who pays for that?

My father.

You can't live off your parents.

I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

When I first came to
this city, I was 1 4.

My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was in prison.

And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

And then he killed himself.

Then I found aromatherapy. Believe
me, I know exactly how you feel.

The word you're looking for is:

''Anyway. . . . ''

You ready?

-I don't think so.

Cut, cut, cut.

Welcome to the real world!

It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

That's it.

You gonna crash on the couch?

-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

Look what I just
found on the floor.

What?

That's Paul's watch.

You can just put it back
where you found it.

Oh, boy! All right.

-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

-I'm sorry.
-No!

-No, have it, really.
-Split it?

You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had. . .

. . .a major crush on you.

I knew.

You did?

I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

I did.

Listen, do you think--

And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

Do you think it would be okay if
I asked you out sometime, maybe?

Maybe.

Okay, maybe I will.

-Good night.
-Good night.

See you.

Wait, wait.

What's with you?

I just grabbed a spoon.

I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

-What? I said you had--
-What? I said you had--

Would you stop?

Was I doing it again?

Would anybody like more coffee?

Did you make it?

-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

Kids, new dream.

I'm in Las Vegas.

I'm Liza Minnelli.

The One Where It All Began (Pilot)

There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

You're going out with the guy.

There has to be something
wrong with him.

All right, Joey.
Be nice.

So does he have a hump
and a hairpiece?

Wait, does he eat chalk?

I don't want her to go through
what I did with Carl.

Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.

to dinner and not having sex.

Sounds like a date to me.

there.

- Instead of

Never had that one.

All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

What do I do?
Everyone starts looking at me.

They weren't looking at you before?

Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it.

And it turns out it's my mother.

Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

Hi.

He says, "Hello,"
I want to kill myself.

You okay?

I feel like someone pulled my
intestine out of my mouth..

- and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

Carol moved her stuff out today.

- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.

- No, you don't.

No, I don't.
To hell with her. She left me!

You never knew she was a lesbian?

No! Okay?

Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

She didn't know.
How should I know?

Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

Did I say that out loud?

I told Mom and Dad last night.
They took it pretty well.

Oh, really?

So that hysterical phone call
from a woman sobbing..

"I'll never have grandchildren,"
was what? A wrong number?

Sorry.

Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

You're angry.
You're hurting.

Can I tell you what
the answer is?

Strip joints!

Hey, you're single.
Have some hormones.

But I don't want
to be single, okay?

I just want to be married again.

And I just want a million dollars!

- Rachel?
- Oh, Monica! Thank God!

I went to your building..

and a guy with a hammer
said you'd be here, and you are.

- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.

Everybody, this is Rachel,
a Lincoln High survivor.

This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe..

Joey.
Remember my brother, Ross?

Sure!

You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

I was in the room
with all the presents..

and I was looking at this
really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

When all of a sudden

Sweet 'N Low?

I realized I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than Barry.

I got freaked out,
and it hit me:

like Mr. Potato Head.

I always knew
he looked familiar, but..

I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering..

"Why am I doing this,"
and "Who am I doing it for?"

I didn't know where to go,
and I know we've drifted apart..

but you're the only person
I know here.

- Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
- I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.

I guess he bought her the pipe organ,
and she's really not happy about it.

"Tuna or egg salad!
Decide!"

"I'll have whatever
Christina's having."

Daddy, I just
I can't marry him.

I'm sorry.
I just don't love him.

Well, it matters to me!

"If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off."

She should not be
wearing those pants.

Push her down the stairs!

Push her!
Push her down the stairs!

Come on, Daddy, listen!

All my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!"

"You're a shoe!"

What if I don't want to be a shoe?

What if I want to be a purse?

Or a hat?

No, I don't want you
to buy me a hat!

It's a metaphor, Daddy!

You can see where he'd have trouble.

Look, Daddy,
it's my life.

Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

Well, maybe that's my decision.

Maybe I don't need your money.

Wait!
I said maybe!

Just breathe. That's it.

Try to think of nice, calm things.

Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

La la la something
And noodles with string

I'm all better now.

I helped.

This is probably for the best.

Independence. Controlling your life.
The whole hat thing.

You can always come to Joey.

Me and Chandler live across the hall.
He's away a lot.

Stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

Like there's a rule, or something?

I got it.

Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

It's Paul.

Oh, God, is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

- Who's Paul?
- Paul, the wine guy?

Maybe.

Your "not a real date"
is with Paul, the wine guy?

- He finally asked you out?
- Yes!

It's a "Dear Diary" moment.

- Rach, I can cancel.
- Please, go, I'll be fine.

Ross, are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

That'd be good.

- Really?- Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

Does he sell it, drink it?

Or he just complains a lot?

Hi, come in!
Paul, this is..

everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

- The wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name. Paul?

I'll be right back.
I've just gotta go

A-wandering?

Change.

Sit down.
Two seconds.

I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

Hey, Paul, here's a tip.

She really likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot..

until it starts to get red.

Shut up, Joey!

What are you up to tonight?

I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon..

so, nothing.

Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

Although, Aruba.
This time of year?

Talk about your..

big lizards.

If you don't want
to be alone tonight..

Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

We're very excited about it.

Thanks. But I'm just
going to hang out here.

- It's been a long day.
- Oh, sure.

Phoebe, wanna help?

I wish I could,
but I don't want to.

Love is sweet as summer showers
Love is a wondrous work of art

But your love
Oh, your love, your love

Is like a giant pigeon

Crapping on my heart

Thank you.

I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things..

using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever..

and I cannot feel my legs.

- We got a bookcase.
- It's beautiful.

What's this?

I would have to say
that is an L-shaped bracket.

- Which goes where?
- I have no idea.

- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.

This was Carol's favorite beer.

She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

- Start with that, we're out of here.
- Please don't spoil all this fun.

Let me ask you.

She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

What did you get?

- You guys.
- You got screwed.

- Oh, my God.
- I know. I'm such an idiot.

I should've known when she went to
the dentist five times a week.

I mean, how clean can teeth get?

My brother's going through that.

How did you get over it?

He might accidentally
break something valuable of hers.

- Say her
- Leg?

That's one way of doing it.
I went for the watch.

You actually broke her watch?

The worst I ever did was shred
my old boyfriend's favorite towel.

- Steer clear of you.
- That's right.

Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

It's about me.
And I just

The machine cut me off again.
Anyway..

I know that some lucky girl is going
to become Mrs. Barry Finkel.

But it isn't me.
It's not me.

Not that I have any idea who "me" is
right now, but you just

I'm divorced.

- I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!
- Shut up!

That only took me an hour.

We haven't had a relationship
that's lasted longer than a Mento.

You have had the love of a woman
for four years.

Four years of closeness and sharing,
after which she ripped your heart out.

That is why we don't do it!

I don't think that was my point!

Know what's scary? What if there's
only one woman for everybody?

I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

What are you talking about?
One woman.

That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream.

Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

Rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

It's the best thing
to happen to you!

You got married.
You were like, what, 8?

Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

- I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
- Then stay out of my freezer.

Ever since she walked out on me..

What?

You wanna spell it out with noodles?

It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

So there's going to be
a fifth date?

Isn't there?

Yeah, yeah.
I think there is.

What were you going to say?

Ever since she left me..

I haven't been able to perform..

sexually.

Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.

Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

How long?

- Two years.
- Wow.

I'm glad you smashed her watch.

So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

We are gathered here
to join Joanie Louise Cunningham..

and Charles.
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi..

in the bonds of holy matrimony.

See!

But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

"Grab a spoon."

Do you know how long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

Great story.
But I gotta go.

I got a date with Andrea.
Angela. No, Andrea.

Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.

Right, thanks. It's Julie.
I'm out of here.

Here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough..

to ask a woman out..

who am I going to ask?

Isn't this amazing?
I've never made coffee in my life.

- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.

If I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

I think it's, "If I can invade Poland,
there's nothing I can't do."

If you feel like you have to make
a Western omelet or something..

Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

- Good morning.
- Good morning.

- Morning.
- Morning, Paul.

- Hello, Paul.
- Hi. Paul, is it?

- Thank you so much.
- Stop.

Last night was like
all my birthdays, both graduations..

plus the barn-raising scene
in Witness.

We'll talk later.

Thank you.

That wasn't a real date.

What the hell do you do
on a real date?

Shut up and put my table back.

I've got to get to work.

If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

So, like, you guys all have jobs?

Yeah, we all have jobs.
That's how we buy stuff.

- Yeah, I'm an actor.
- Have I seen you in anything?

I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

Unless you saw the Wee One's
production of Pinocchio..

at the little theater
in the park?

It was a job!

"Look, Geppetto.
I'm a real live boy."

- I will not take this abuse.
- You're right, I'm sorry.

Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

You should both know
that he's a dead man.

Oh, Chandler!

How are you doing today?
Sleep okay?

Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

I know.
He's just so..

- Remember you and Tony Demarco?
- Oh, yeah.

Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

- Wow, are you in trouble!
- Big time!

Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.

I think we're getting a little
ahead of ourselves.

I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

Or else I'm going to get up
and go to work.

- Wish me luck!
- What for?

I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

- Hi, Monica.
- Franny, welcome back.

- How was Florida?
- You had sex, didn't you?

- How do you do that?
- I hate you.

I'm pushing my aunt through
Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.

So, who?

You know Paul?

Paul, the wine guy?
Yeah, I know Paul.

You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

What?
I take credit for Paul.

Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

Of course it was a line.

Why would anybody
do something like that?

I assume we want an answer
more sophisticated than:

"To get you into bed."

I hate men.

Don't hate. You don't want
to put that out into the universe.

Is it me?

Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs..

and men with emotional problems
can hear?

Come here.
Give me your feet.

I just thought he was nice, you know?

I can't believe
you didn't know it was a line.

- Guess what?
- You got a job?

Are you kidding?
I'm trained for nothing.

- I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
- You're surprisingly upbeat.

You'd be too,
if you found these boots on sale..


How well you know me.

They're my
"I don't need a job..

I've got great boots" boots.

- How did you pay?
- Credit card.

And who pays for that?

My father.

Is this really necessary?
I can stop charging any time.

You can't live off your parents.

I know that.
That's why I was getting married.

Give her a break.
It's hard being on your own.

Thank you.

I remember when I first
came to this city, I was 14.

Mom had killed herself,
stepdad was in jail.

I didn't know anybody here.

I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

And then he killed himself.

Then I found aromatherapy.
So I know exactly how you feel.

The word you're looking for is:

"Anyway.."

- You ready?
- No, how can I be ready?

"Ready to jump out of the plane
with no parachute?"

- I can't do this.
- I know you can.

- No.
- You made coffee, you can do anything.

Cut. Cut. Cut.

You know what?
I think we can leave it at that.

- Kind of a symbolic gesture.
- Rachel, that was a library card.

If you listen closely, you can hear
a thousand retailers scream.

Welcome to the real world!

It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

That's it.
Are you going to crash on the couch?

- No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?

Look what I just
found on the floor.

What?

That's Paul's watch.
Just put it back where you found it.

Oh, boy!
All right.

- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

- I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it.
- Split it?

You probably didn't know this,
but in high school..

I had a major crush on you.

I knew.

You did?

I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

I did.

Listen, do you think..?

Try not to let my vulnerability
become a factor here.

Do you think it would be okay
if I asked you out sometime?

Yeah.

Maybe.

Okay.

Okay, maybe I will.

- Good night.
- Good night.

See you.

Wait, wait.
What's with you?

I just grabbed a spoon.

- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Can't believe what I'm hearing

- What? I said
-  What? I said

- Would you stop?
- Was I doing it again?

Yes!

I said you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.

- You won't know a butt if it bit you.
- There's an image.

Would anybody like more coffee?

You made it,
or you're serving it?

- I'm just serving it.
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

Kids, new dream.

I'm in Las Vegas.

Miss, more coffee?

Could you give this
to that guy over there?

Go ahead.
Thank you.

Sorry.
Okay, Las Vegas.

I'm in Las Vegas.

I'm Liza Minnelli..

The One Where It All Began

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

You're going out with a guy.

There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

All right, Joey, be nice.

So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

Wait. Does he eat chalk?

I don't want her to go
through what I did with Carl.

Okay, everybody relax.

Relax. This is not even a date.

It's just two people going out to
dinner and not having sex.

Sounds like a date to me.

I'm in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria. . .

. . .and I realize I'm totally naked.

I've had that dream.

Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone. . .

. . .there.

-Instead of--
-That's right!

That one, I've never had.

All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

I don't know what to do.
Everybody's looking at me.

They weren't looking at you before?

Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it.

And it turns out it's my mother.

Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

This guy says, ''Hello,''
I wanna kill myself.

You okay, sweetie?

I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth. . .

-. . .and tied it around my neck.
-Cookie?

Carol moved out today.

-Let me get you some coffee.
-Thanks.

No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

Just leave my aura alone, okay?

Fine. Be murky.

I'll be fine.
I hope she'll be very happy.

No, you don't.

To hell with her. She left me!

And you never knew she was a lesbian.

Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

She didn't know.
How should I know?

Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

Did I say that out loud?

I told Mom and Dad last night.
They seemed to take it well.

Really? So that hysterical call I got
from a woman sobbing at 3 a.m. . .

. . . ''I'll never have grandchildren! ''

Was, what? A wrong number?

Sorry.

Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

You're angry. You're hurting.

Can I tell you what
the answer is?

Strip joints!

Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

I just want to be married again.

And I just want a million dollars!

Rachel?

Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said. . .

. . .that you might be here and you are.

-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe. . .

. . .and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

Sure!

You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

I was in this room with
all the presents. . .

. . .and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

When all of a sudden I realize--
Sweet 'N Low?

I realized. . .

. . .I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

And then I really freaked out,
when it hit me:

How much Barry looks like
Mr. Potato Head.

I always knew he looked
familiar, but. . . .

I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .

. . . ''Why am I doing this?''
and ''Who am I doing this for?''

I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

. . .but you're the only person
I know in the city.

Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

I guess he bought her
the pipe organ. . .

. . .and she's really not
happy about it.

''Tuna or egg salad?''

''Decide! ''

''I'll have whatever
Christine is having. ''

Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

I'm sorry.

I just don't love him.

Well, it matters to me!

''If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off. ''

She should not be
wearing those pants.

I say push her down the stairs!

Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

Come on, Daddy, listen!

All my life, everyone's
always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''

''You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! ''

I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

What if I want to be a purse?

Or a hat?''

I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I--

It's a metaphor, Daddy!

You can see where he'd have trouble.

Look, Daddy, it's my life.

Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

Well, maybe that's my decision.

Well, maybe I don't need your money.

Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.

Just try to think
of nice, calm things.

Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

La la la something
And noodles with string

-These are a--
-I'm all better now.

I helped.

This is probably for
the best, you know?

Independence.
Taking control of your life.

The whole ''hat'' thing.

If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

What? Like there's
a rule or something?

I got it.

Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

It's Paul.

Oh, God. Is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

Maybe.

Your ''not a real date,''
is with Paul, the wine guy?

He finally asked you out?

It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

Rach, I can cancel.

Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.

Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

That'd be good.

-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

Does he sell it, drink it,
or he just complains a lot?

Hi, come in! Paul, this is. . .

. . .everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

I'll be right back.
I've just got to go a--

A-wandering?

Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.

I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

Hey, Paul. Here's a little tip.

She likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot. . .

. . .over and over again, till
it starts to get a little red.

Shut up, Joey!

Rachel, what are you
up to tonight?

I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon. . .

. . .so, nothing.

Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

Although, Aruba. This time of year?
Talk about your. . .

. . .big lizards.

If you don't feel
like being alone tonight. . .

. . .Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

And we're very excited about it.

Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

-It's been a long day.
-Okay. Sure.

Pheebs, wanna help?

I wish I could, but I don't want to.

Love is sweet as summer showers

Love is a wondrous work of art

But your love, oh, your love
Your love

Is like a giant pigeon

Crapping on my heart

Thank you!

I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things. . .

. . .using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .

. . .and I cannot feel my legs.

We got a bookcase here.

It's a beautiful thing.

What's this?

I would have to say that is
an L-shaped bracket.

-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

This was Carol's favorite beer.

She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

If you start with that,
we're out of here.

Please don't spoil all this fun.

Let me ask you a question.

She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

What did you get?

You guys.

-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.

-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

I mean, how clean can teeth get?

My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

How did you get through it?

He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

-Say her--
-Leg?

That's one way of going through it.

Me, I went for the watch.

You actually broke her watch?
The worst thing I ever did was. . .

. . .I shredded my old boyfriend's
favorite bath towel.

-Steer clear of you!
-That's right.

Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

It's about me.
And I just--

Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .

I know that some girl is going to be
lucky to become Mr. Barry Finkel.

But it isn't me.
It's not me.

Not that I have any idea who ''me'' is
right now, but give me a chance to--

I'm divorced!

I'm only 26 and I'm divorced.

Shut up.

That only took me an hour.

Between us, we haven't had a
relationship last longer than a Mento.

You, however, have had the love
of a woman for four years.

Four years of closeness and sharing.

After which,
she ripped your heart out. . .

. . .and that is why we don't do it.

I don't think that was my point.

You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?

I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

What are you talking about?
One woman.

That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

Rocky road, and cookie dough,
and bing cherry vanilla.

You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.

This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

You got married. You were
like, what? Eight?

Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

Then stay out of my freezer.

Ever since she
walked out on me, I. . . .

What? What?

You wanna spell it out with noodles?

It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

So there's going to be a fifth date?

Isn't there?

Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

What were you going to say?

Ever since she left me. . .

. . .I haven't been able to perform. . .

. . .sexually.

Oh, God! Oh, God!

I'm so sorry.

Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

How long?

Two years.

I'm glad you smashed her watch.

So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

Yeah, I do.

We are gathered here
to join together...

...Joanie Louise Cunningham...

...and Charles Chachi,
Chachi, Chachi...

...in the bonds of holy matrimony.

-Marriage is the most sacred--
-See!

But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

''Grab a spoon. ''

Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a
hero,'' mean anything to you?

Great story. But I gotta go.

I got a date with Andrea.

Angela. Andrea. Oh, man.

Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.

Right, thanks. It's Julie.
I'm out of here.

You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough. . .

. . .to ask a woman out. . .

. . .who am I going to ask?

Isn't this amazing?

I have never made coffee
before in my life.

-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

I figure if I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

I think it's, ''If I can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do. ''

If you feel like you gotta make
a Western omelet or something. . . .

Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

-Good morning.
-Good morning.

-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

Thank you.

-Thank you so much.
-Stop!

Last night was like. . .

. . .all my birthdays, graduations, plus
the barn-raising scene in Witness.

We'll talk later.

Thank you.

That wasn't a real date.

What the hell do you do
on a real date?

Shut up and put my table back.

I've got to get to work.

If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

So, like, you guys all have jobs?

Yeah, we all have jobs.

That's how we buy stuff.

Yeah, I'm an actor.

Have I seen you in anything?

I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

Unless you happen to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio...

. . .at the Little Theater in the Park.

It was a job, all right?

''Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy. ''

I will not take this abuse.

You're right. I'm sorry.

Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

You should both know that
he's a dead man.

Oh, Chandler!

How are you doing today?
You sleep okay?

Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

I know. He's just so--

Remember you and Tony De Marco?

Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

-Are you in trouble!
-Big time!

Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.

We're getting a little
ahead of ourselves here.

I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

Or else I'm just going
to get up and go to work.

-Wish me luck!
-What for?

I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

How was Florida?

You had sex, didn't you?

How do you do that?

I hate you. I'm pushing my
aunt through Parrot Jungle. . .

. . .and you're having sex.

So, who?

You know Paul?

Paul, the wine guy?

Yeah, I know Paul.

You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

Of course it was a line.

Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than. . .

. . . ''To get you into bed. ''

I hate men. I hate men!

Don't hate. Don't put that out
in the universe.

Is it me?

Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs. . .

. . .and men with emotional
problems can hear?

Come here.
Give me your feet.

I just thought he was
nice, you know?

I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

Guess what?

-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

I'm trained for nothing.

I was laughed out of 12 interviews.

You're surprisingly upbeat.

You would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale. . .

. . .50% percent off.

How well you know me.

They're my, ''I don't need
a job or my parents.

I've got great boots,'' boots.

-How did you pay for them?
-Credit card.

And who pays for that?

My father.

Come on, is this necessary?

I can stop charging any time I want.

You can't live off your parents.

I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

When I first came to
this city, I was 1 4.

My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was in prison.

And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

And then he killed himself.

Then I found aromatherapy. Believe
me, I know exactly how you feel.

The word you're looking for is:

''Anyway. . . . ''

You ready?

No, I'm not ready.
How can I be ready?

''You ready to jump out of
the plane without a chute?''

I can't do this.

-I know you can.
-I don't think so.

You made coffee.
You can do anything.

Cut, cut, cut.

You know what?

We can just leave it at that.
Like a symbolic gesture.

That was a library card.

If you listen very closely, you can
hear a thousand retailers scream.

Welcome to the real world!

It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

That's it.

You gonna crash on the couch?

-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

Look what I just
found on the floor.

What?

That's Paul's watch.

You can just put it back
where you found it.

Oh, boy! All right.

-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

-I'm sorry.
-No!

-No, have it, really.
-Split it?

You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had. . .

. . .a major crush on you.

I knew.

You did?

I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

I did.

Listen, do you think--

And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

Do you think it would be okay if
I asked you out sometime, maybe?

Maybe.

Okay, maybe I will.

-Good night.
-Good night.

See you.

Wait, wait.

What's with you?

I just grabbed a spoon.

I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

I can 't believe
What I'm hearing

-What? I said you had--
-What? I said you had--

Would you stop?

Was I doing it again?

I said that you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.

You wouldn't know a great
butt if it bit you.

There's an image.

Would anybody like more coffee?

Did you make it?

-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

Kids, new dream.

I'm in Las Vegas.

Miss, more coffee?

Excuse me? Could you give this
to that guy over there?

Go ahead.

Thank you.

Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.

So I'm in Las Vegas.

I'm Liza Minnelli.

What you guys don't understand is, for us,

kissing is as important as any part of it.

Yeah, right!

You serious?

Oh, yeah!

Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

Absolutely.

Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much

like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's
like the stand-up comedian you have to sit

through before Pink Floyd comes out.

Yeah, and-and it's not that 
we don't like the comedian,

it's that-that... that's not

why we bought the ticket.

The problem is, though, after the concert's
over, no matter how great the show was,

you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?

I mean, we're in the car,
we're fighting traffic... basically

just trying to stay awake.

Yeah, well, word of advice: 
Bring back the comedian.

Otherwise next time you're
gonna find yourself

sitting at home, listening
to that album alone.

Are we still talking about sex?

FRIENDS

the sonogram at the end

No, it's good, it is good, 
it's just that... mm...

Doesn't she seem a little angry?

Well, she has issues.

Does she.

He's out banging other women over the
head with a club, while she sits at home

trying to get the mastodon 
smell out of the carpet!

Marsha, these are cave people. Okay?

They have issues like...

'Gee, that glacier's
getting kinda close.' See?

Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
No. No.

Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!

Okay, okay, yes, it is.

How about I'll, uh, catch up 
with you in the Ice Age.

Hi.

So.

You look great. I, uh...

I hate that.

Sorry. Thanks.

You look good too.

Ah, well, in here, 
anyone who...

stands erect...

So what's new? Still, uh...

A lesbian?

Well... you never know.

How's, um... how's the family?

Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh...

Why... why are you here, Carol?

I'm pregnant.

Pregnant?!

Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company
where there's some kind of misunderstanding.

Then I've already seen this one!

Are you through with that?

Yeah, sorry, the swallowing 
slowed me down.

Whose little ball of paper is this?!

Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a
note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it,

so I balled it up and... 
...now I wish I was dead.

She's already fluffed that pillow...

Monica, you know, you've 
already fluffed that...
...but, it's fine!

Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give
them any more ammunition than they already have.

Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent

can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.

Monica... Hi! 
Um, Monica, you're scaring me.

I mean, you're like, you're like all
chaotic and twirly.

And not-not in a good way.

Yeah, calm down.

You don't see Ross getting all
chaotic and twirly every time they come.

That's because as far as my parents are
concerned, Ross can do no wrong.

Y'see, he's the Prince.

Apparently they had some
big ceremony before I was born.

Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
What?

Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!

Eeaagh!

Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Yeah, it's beautiful.

Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....

No, look, don't touch that!

Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough, having to give it back to him...

'Hi Barry! Remember me? 
I'm the girl in the veil

who stomped on your heart 
in front of your entire family!'

Oh God and now I'm gonna have to 
return the ring, without the ring,

which makes it so much harder...

Easy Rach, we'll find it. 
Won't we!

Oh! Yeah!

Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?

Doy! 
Probably right before she lost it!

You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...

I know I had it this morning,

and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...

...Dinah?

Ohhhhh, don't be mad...

You didn't.
Oh, I am sorry...

I gave you one job!

Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!

Now, Monica, you know that's not how you
look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...

I just... can't do it.

Boys?

We're going in.

Hi.

Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Carol's pregnant.

Ooh! I found it!

W... w... wh... 
wha... w... w... w...

Yeah. Do that for another two hours,

you might be where I am right about now.

Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in
perspective, huh, Mon?

Well now, how...
how do you fit into this whole thing?

Well, Carol says she and Susan want me
to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable

with it, I don't have to be involved..

basically it's entirely up to me.

She is so great! I miss her.

What does she mean by 'involved'?

I mean presumably, the biggest part of
your job is done.

Anyway, they want me to go down to this...

sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

So what are you gonna do?

I have no idea.

No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

.....Well, this is still ruined, right?

Oh, Martha Ludwin's
daughter is gonna call you.

Mmm! What's that curry taste?

Curry.
Mmmm!

I- I think they're great! I, I really do.

Do you remember the Ludwins?
The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?

They all had a thing for him.

Aw, Mom...

I'm sorry, why is this 
girl going to call me?

Oh, she just graduated, and she wants
 to be something in cooking, or food, or...

I don't know.

Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant...

No Mom, I don't have a restaurant,
I work in a restaurant.

Well, they don't have to know that...

Ross, could you come and help me
with the spaghetti, please?

Yeah.
Oh, we're having spaghetti!

That's.... easy.

I know this is going to sound 
unbelievably selfish,

but, were you planning on bringing
up the whole baby/lesbian thing?

Because I think it might take 
some of the heat off me.

What that Rachel did to her life...
We ran into her parents at the club,

they were not playing very well.

I'm not gonna tell you what
they spent on that wedding...

but forty thousand dollars
 is a lot of money!

Well, at least she had the
chance to leave a man at the altar...

What's that supposed to mean?

Nothing!

It's an expression.
No it's not.

Don't listen to your mother.
You're independent, and you always have been!

Even when you were a kid...

and you were chubby, and you had 
no friends, you were just fine!

And you would read alone in your room,
and your puzzles...

Look, there are people like Ross
who need to shoot for the stars,

with his museum,
and his papers getting published.

Other people are satisfied with
staying where they are...

I'm telling you,
these are the people who never get cancer.

And I read about these women 
trying to have it all,

and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica'
doesn't seem to have that problem.

So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?

No news, no little anecdotes 
to share with the folks?

Okay! Okay.
Look, I, uh... I realise you guys

have been wondering what exactly

happened between Carol and me, and,
so, well, here's the deal.

Carol's a lesbian.

She's living with a woman named Susan.

She's pregnant with my child, and she and

Susan are going to raise the baby.

And you knew about this?!

Your folks are really that bad, huh?

Well, y'know, these people are pros.

They know what they're doing,
they take their time,

they get the job done.

Boy, I know they say
you can't change your parents...

boy, if you could...
I'd want yours.

Must pee.

Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.

You're twins?
Yeah. We don't speak.

She's like this high-powered, 
driven career type.

What does she do?
She's a waitress.

All right, you guys, 
I kinda gotta clean up now.

Chandler, you're an only child, right?
You don't have any of this.

Well, no, although I did have an 
imaginary friend, who...

my parents actually preferred.

The lights, please...

How long was I in there?

I'm just cleaning up.

D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?

Uh.. okay, sure!
Thanks!

Anyway.. um..

So, you... uh... 
you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

Oh.. a little.. 
Mm-hmm.. A lot.

Mm.
So, got any advice?

Y'know, as someone who's 
recently been... dumped?

Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'.

Chances are he's gonna be this,
this broken shell of a man, y'know,

so you should try not to look too terrific,
I know it'll be hard.

Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll 
give Barry back his ring,

and you can go with 
Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...

Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow...

When did it get so complicated?

Got me.

Remember when we were
in high school together?
Yeah.

I mean, didn't you think you were just
gonna meet somone, fall in love...

and that'd be it?

...Ross?
Yes, yes!

Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..

Me neither...

Hi. Sorry I'm late,
I was stuck at work.

There was this big dinosaur... thing...
anyway.

Hi.

Ross, you remember Susan.
How could I forget?

Ross.
Hello, Susan.
 Good shake. Good shake.

So, uh, we're just waiting for...?

Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he...

She.
...she, of course

She... uh... familiar with our...
special situation?

Yes, and she's very supportive.

Okay, that's great.

No, I'm... Oh.

Thanks.

Ross? That opens my cervix.

Barry?

C'mon in.

Are you sure?

Yeah! It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

So, how ya doin?

I'm... uh...

I'm okay...

You look great!

Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.

Be right there.
Be back in a sec.

I dumped him.
Okay.

So, um... so how's this, uh,
how's this gonna work?

Y'know, with us?

Y'know, when, like, important 
decisions have to be made?

Give me a 'for instance'.

Well, uh, uh, I don't know, 
okay, okay,

How about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
-Marlon!
-Marlen?

...if it's a boy, 
Minnie if it's a girl.

...As in Mouse?

As in my grandmother.

Still, you... you say Minnie, 
you hear Mouse.

Um, how about, um...

how about Julia?

Julia.

We agreed on Minnie.

'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend
the rest of our lives together.

Things change, 
roll with the punches.

I believe Julia's on the table...?

Sorry about that.

So. What have you been up to?

Oh, not much.

I... I got a job.

Oh, that's great.

Why are... why are you so tanned?

Oh, I, uh... I went to Aruba.

Oh no.
You went on our honeymoon alone?

No.

I went with, uh..
Now, this may hurt.

Me?!

No!
I went with Mindy.

Mindy?

Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!

Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.

Oh! Well, um..
You've got plugs!

Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.

And you've got lenses!

But you hate sticking 
your finger in your eye!

Not for her.

Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Okay...

See, about a month ago,
I wanted to hurt you.

More than I've ever wanted to 
hurt anyone in my life.

And I'm an orthodontist.

You know, you were right?

I mean, I thought we were happy.

We weren't happy.

But with Mindy, now I'm happy.

Spit.

What?

Me.

Anyway, um,

I guess this belongs to you.

And thank you for giving it to me.

Well, thank you for giving it back.

Hello?!

Oh, please! 
What's wrong with Helen?

Helen Geller?

I don't think so.

Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Thank you!

No, I mean it's not Geller.

What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

No, actually, um,
we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.

Well, wait a minute, wha...
why is she in the title?

It's my baby too.

Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember
you making any sperm.

Yeah, and we all know 
what a challenge that is!

All right, you two, stop it!

No no no, she gets a credit, hey,
I'm in there too.

Ross. You're not actually suggesting
Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller?

'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.

Of course not, I'm... 
suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.

Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? 
He knows no-one's gonna say all
those names, so they'll wind up calling her
Geller, then he gets his way!

My way?! 
You... you think this is my way?

Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being, this is not my way...

y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard.
I'm not, I can't do...

How are we today?
Any nausea?

Yeah. 
Yeah. 
A little.

Well, I was just wondering about the 
mother-to-be, but... thanks for sharing.

Uh, lie back..

You... uh... y'know what, 
I'm gonna go.

I don't... I don't think I can be involved in this
particular thing right now.

Oh my God.

Look at that.

I know.

Well? Isn't that amazing?

What are we supposed to be seeing here?

I dunno, but... I think it's 
about to attack the Enterprise.

You know, if you tilt your head to the left,

and relax your eyes,
it kinda looks like an old potato.

Then don't do that, alright?
Okay!

Monica. Whaddya think?
Mm-hmm.

Wh... are you welling up?

No.

You are, you're welling up.
Am not!

You're gonna be an aunt.
Oh shut up!

Hi, Mindy.

Hi, it... it's Rachel.

Yeah, I'm fine. I... 
I saw Barry today.

Oh, yeah, yeah he... he told me.
No, no, it's okay.

I hope you two are very happy,
I really do.

Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if...if

everything works out, and you guys end
up getting married and having kids...

and everything... 
I just hope they have his old
hairline and your old nose.

Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.

The One With the Sonogram at the End

No, it's good. It is good.

It's just that Doesn't she seem
a little angry?

Well, she has issues.

Does she?

Try to live with "Mr. I'm Evolving."

He's out while she's home getting
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

Marsha, see, these are cave people.

Okay, they have issues like:

"Gee, that glacier's

I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age.

- No.

- Hi.
- Hi.

- Is this a bad time?
- No, it's..

the Stone Age.

You look great. I hate that.

Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

Well, you know,
in here, anyone who..

stands erect..

- What's new? Still a
- A lesbian?

You never know. How's the family?

- Marty's still totally paranoid.
- Carol, why are you here?

- I'm pregnant.
- Pregnant.

She didn't leave
in such a hurry after all.

This is the Three's Company episode
with a misunderstanding.

Then I've already seen this one.

Are you through with that?

Sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

You already fluffed It's fine.

I just don't wanna give them
any more ammunition.

Parents can be cruel about
the flatness of a child's pillow.

Relax, you do this every time.
The place looks great.

You got a lasagna here
that looks good enough..

to avoid touching.

Monica? Hi!

Monica, you're scaring me.

I mean, you're all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

Not in a good way.

Calm down. You don't see Ross
getting twirly every time they come.

That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

You see, he's "The Prince."

They had some big ceremony
before I was born.

- What?
- Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

- Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
- It's beautiful.

Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

No, don't touch that.

Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough, having to give it back.

"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl
that stomped on your heart."

Now I must return the ring
without the ring..

which makes it so much harder.

Easy, we'll find it. Won't we?

Look, it's gonna be okay.
You'll give it back..

- and we'll eat ice cream.
- Okay. It's a pear-shaped diamond

Any diamond ring we find,
we'll run it by you.

- When did you have it last?
- Doy, right before she lost it.

You don't get
a lot of "doy" these days.

I know I had it this morning.

I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with

Dinah?

- Oh, don't be mad.
- You didn't.

- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I gave you one job!

But look how straight
those noodles are.

That's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

I just can't do it.

Boys? We're going in.

Hi.

- That is not a happy "hi."
- Carol's pregnant.

I found it!

What?

Yeah.

Do that for two hours, you might
be where I am about now.

That puts that whole
pillow thing in perspective.

How do you fit into this whole thing?

Carol and Susan want me
to be involved.

But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

- It's totally up to me.
- She is so great. I miss her.

- What does she mean by "involved"?
- Your job is done.

And the most enjoyable.

Phoebe, say something.

They want me to go down
to this sonogram thing..

with them tomorrow.

Remember when life was simpler..

and she was just a lesbian?

Those were the days.

- What are you gonna do?
- I have no idea.

No matter what I do,
I'm still gonna be a father.

This is still ruined, right?

Martha Lugwin's daughter
is gonna call you.

- What's that curry taste?
- Curry.

I think they're great. I really do.

The big Lugwin had a thing for you.

- They all had a thing for him.
- Oh, Mom.

Why is this girl going to call me?

She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking or food..

I told her you have a restaurant

- I don't have, I work in a restaurant.
- They don't have to know that.

- Ross, help me with the spaghetti.
- Yes.

Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's easy.

We were going to have lasagna.

- I love lasagna.
- We're not having it.

Then why bring it up? He latches on.

This will sound unbelievably selfish..

but did you plan to bring
up the baby/lesbian thing?

It might take the heat off of me.

That Rachel.
We saw her parents at the club.

They were not playing well.

I won't say what they spent..

but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding.

At least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

- It's an expression.
- No, it's not.

Don't listen to her.
You've always been independent.

Even when you were a chubby kid..

and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

You'd read alone in your room.
Your puzzles..

People like Ross need
to shoot for the stars.

With his museum
and his published papers.

Others are satisfied with
staying where they are.

These people never get cancer.

They're happy with what
they have, content..

like cows.

Cows, Dad?

She knows how much I love cows.

I read about women trying
to have it all, and I thank God..

our "Harmonica"
doesn't have that problem.

- I'm telling you, you'll be fine.
- Thank you, Daddy.

Oh, so this does work.

So, Ross, what's going on with you?

Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

Look, I realize you guys
have been wondering..

what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

And so, well, here's the deal.

Carol's a lesbian.

She lives with a woman named Susan.

She's pregnant with my child.

She and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

And you knew about this?

Folks are really that bad?

Well, you know, these people are pros.

They know what they do.

They take their time.
They get the job done.

They say that you can't change
your parents.

Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

Must pee.

It's worse when you're twins.

- You're a twin?
- We don't speak.

She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

- What does she do?
- She's a waitress.

- Identical?
- People say we look alike.

But I don't see it.

You guys, I kind of
gotta clean up now.

Chandler, as an only child,
you don't have this.

No, although I did have
an imaginary friend..

who my parents preferred.

Hit the lights, please.

How long was I in there?

- I'm just cleaning up.
- Oh, you need any help?

Okay, sure. Thanks.

Anyway..

So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

A little.

A lot.

So, got any advice?

You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

You may wanna steer clear
of the word "dumped."

Chances are he's gonna be
this broken shell of a man.

You should try not to look
too terrific. I know it'll be hard.

Or I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the ob-gyn.

You've got Carol tomorrow.

- When did it get so complicated?
- Got me.

- Remember being in high school?
- Yeah.

Didn't you think you'd meet someone..

fall in love, and that'd be it?

- Ross?
- Yes. Yes.

Man, I never thought I'd be here.

Me neither.

Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway..

Hi.

- You remember Susan.
- How could I forget?

Hello, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

So, we're just waiting for?

- Dr. Oberman.
- And is he?

- She.
- Of course, "she."

Is she familiar with our
special situation?

- Yes, and she's very supportive.
- Okay, that's great.

No, I'm Oh.

Thanks.

That opens my cervix.

- Barry?
- Come on in.

- Are you sure?
- It's fine.

Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

So, how are you doing?

I'm..

I'm okay.

- You look great.
- Yeah, well.

Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.

Be right there. Be back in a second.

I dumped him.

So, how's this all gonna work?

The baby grows
in a special place inside

Thank you.

I mean, how's this gonna work,
you know, with us?

When important decisions
have to be made?

- Give me a "for instance."
- Well, I don't know.

- How about with the baby's name?
- Marlon.

If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

As in "Mouse"?

As in my grandmother.

Still, you say "Minnie,"
you hear "Mouse."

How about..?

How about Julia?

- Julia.
- We agreed on Minnie.

We agreed we'd spend
our lives together.

Things change.
Roll with the punches.

I believe Julia's on the table?

Sorry about that.

So, what have you been up to?

Oh, not much.

- I got a job.
- That's great.

Why are you so tan?

I went to Aruba.

Oh, no. You went
on our honeymoon alone?

No.

I went with..

- Now, this may hurt.
- Me?

No.

I went with Mindy.

Mindy?

My maid of honor, Mindy?

Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.

You got plugs!

Careful. They haven't quite taken yet.

And you got lenses.

You hate sticking your finger
in your eye.

Not for her.

Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

Okay.

A month ago, I wanted to hurt you
more than I've ever wanted to.

And I'm an orthodontist.

You know, you were right.
I thought we were happy.

We weren't happy.

But with Mindy..

now I'm happy.

- Spit.
- What?

Me.

Anyway..

I guess this belongs to you.
Or maybe some day Mindy.

Like she'd settle for that.

Yeah, that's true.

But I think it's a nice ring..

and thank you for giving it to me.

Thank you for giving it back.

Hello!

- Please, what's wrong with Helen?
- Helen Geller?

- I don't think so.
- It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

- Thank you.
- No, I mean, it's not Geller.

It'll be Helen Willick?

No, actually, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

Wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

It's my baby too.

Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

And we all know what
a challenge that is.

- You two, stop it.
- She gets a credit. I'm in there too.

Helen Willick Bunch Geller?
I think that borders on child abuse.

Of course not.
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

See what he does? He knows no one's
gonna say all those names.

They'll call her Geller.
He gets his way.

My way? You think this is my way?

Of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment being..

this is not my You know what?
This is too hard.

Knock, knock. How are we? Any nausea?

- A little.
- Just a little.

I was wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

- Lie back.
- You know what? I'm gonna go.

I don't think I can be involved
in this family thing.

- Oh, my God!
- Look at that.

I know.

Well, isn't that amazing?

What are we supposed to be
seeing here?

I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

If you tilt your head
and relax your eyes..

it kind of looks
like an old potato.

Then don't do that, all right?

Monica, what do you think?

- Are you welling up?
- No.

- You are. You're welling up.
- I'm not.

- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Oh, shut up.

Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's Rachel.

Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

Yeah, he told me. No, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.

I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

And, Min, you know,
if everything works out..

and you guys get married
and have kids..

I hope they have his hairline
and your nose!

That was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now!

You guys don't understand.

For us, kissing is as
important as any part of it.

Yeah, right!

You serious?

Oh, yeah!

All you need to know
is in the first kiss.

Absolutely.

For us, kissing's an opening act. . .

. . .like the comedian
you have to sit through. . .

. . .before Pink Floyd comes out.

And it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

It's just that that's not. . .

. . .why we bought the ticket.

The problem is, after the concert,
no matter how great the show was. . .

. . .you girls are always looking
for the comedian again.

We're in the car, fighting traffic. . .

. . .just trying to stay awake.

Well, word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

Or next time you'll find yourself
listening to that album alone.

Are we still talking about sex?

The One With the Sonogram at the End

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

No, it's good.
It is good.

It's just that doesn't she seem
a little angry?

Well, she has issues.

Does she?

He's out banging other women
with a club. . .

. . .while she's home getting
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

Marsha, see, these are cave people.

Okay, they have issues like:

''Gee, that glacier's
getting kind of close! '' See?

Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

Yes, it is. Carol, hi!

Okay. Yes, it is.

I'll catch up with you
in the Ice Age.

Hi.

So. . . .

You look great.

I hate that.

Sorry.

Thanks. You look good too.

Well, you know,
in here, anyone who. . .

. . .stands erect. . . .

So what's new?
Still a--

A lesbian?

You never know.

How's the family?

Marty's still totally paranoid.

Carol, why are you here?

I'm pregnant.

Pregnant!

She didn 't leave
in such a hurry after all.

This is the Three's Company episode
where's there's a misunderstanding.

Then I've already seen this one.

Are you through with that?

Sorry, the swallowing
slowed me down.

Whose ball of paper is this?

That's mine. I wrote a note to
myself, then I didn't need it.

So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

She already fluffed that pillow.
You already fluffed-- It's fine.

I don't want to give them
any more ammunition than they have.

We know how cruel parents can be. . .

. . .about the flatness
of a child's pillow.

Monica? Hi!

Monica, you're scaring me.

I mean, you're all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

Not in a good way.

Yeah, calm down.

You don't see Ross getting chaotic
and twirly every time they come.

That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

You see, he's ''The Prince. ''

Apparently they had some big ceremony
before I was born.

-What?
-Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
-Yeah, it's beautiful!

Oh, God! Oh, God!

No, don't touch that.

Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough
having to return it to him.

''Barry, remember me?
I'm the girl. . .

. . .that stomped on your heart
in front of your family''

Now I must return the ring,
without the ring. . .

. . .which makes it so much harder.

Easy, we'll find it.
Won't we?

Okay, look.

When did you have it last?

Doy! Probably
right before she lost it.

You don't get
a lot of ''doy'' these days.

I know I had it this morning.

I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with. . . .

Dinah?

Oh, don't be mad.

-You didn't!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

I gave you one job!

But look how straight
those noodles are.

That's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

I just can't do it.

Boys?

We're going in!

Hi.

That is not a happy ''hi. ''

Carol's pregnant.

I found it!

Yeah.

Do that for two hours. . .

. . .you might be where I am
right about now.

That puts that whole
pillow thing in perspective.

How do you fit
into this whole thing?

Carol says she and Susan
want me to be involved.

But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

Basically, it's totally up to me.

She is so great.
I miss her.

What does she mean by ''involved''?

Presumably, the biggest
part of your job is done.

Anyway, they want me
to go down to this. . .

. . .sonogram thing
with them tomorrow.

What'll you do?

I have no idea.

No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

This is still ruined, right?

Martha Lugwin's daughter
is going to call you.

What's that curry taste?

Curry.

I think they're great.
I really do.

Remember the Lugwins?
The big one had a thing for you.

They all had a thing for him!

Oh, Mom!

Why is this girl going to call me?

She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking, food. . .

. . .or I don't know.

I told her you had a restaurant.

I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.

They don't have to know that.

Ross, help me with the spaghetti.

Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's. . .

. . .easy.

This'll sound unbelievably selfish
on my part. . .

. . .but did you plan on bringing
up the baby/lesbian thing?

It'd take the heat off of me.

What Rachel did to her life!
We ran into her parents at the club.

They were not playing very well.

I won't say what they
spent on that wedding. . .

. . .but $40,000 is a lot of money.

At least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

What's that supposed to mean?

Nothing.

-It's an expression.
-No, it's not.

Don't listen to her!

the people who never get cancer.

I read about women trying
to have it all, and I thank God. . .

. . .our little Harmonica
doesn't have that problem.

So, Ross, what's going on with you?

Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

Look, I realize you guys
have been wondering. . .

. . .what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

So here's the deal.

Carol's a lesbian.

She's living with a woman named Susan.

She's pregnant with my child.

And she and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

And you knew about this?

Your folks are really that bad?

Well, you know, these people are pros.

They know what they do.

Got me.

Remember when we were
in high school together?

Didn't you think you'd meet someone. . .

. . .fall in love, and that'd be it?

Man! I never thought I'd be here.

Yes, and she's very supportive.

Great! Okay, that's great!

No, I'm. . . .

That opens my cervix.

Barry?

Come on in.

Are you sure?

It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

So how are you doing?

I'm. . . .

I'm okay.

You look great.

Dr. Farber, Jason
Greenspan 's gagging.

Be right there.
I'll be back in a second.

I dumped him.

So how's this going to work. . .

. . .you know, with us?

You know, when important
decisions have to be made?

Give me a ''for instance. ''

Well, I don't know.

-How about with the baby's name?
-Marlon. . .

. . .if it's a boy.
Minnie, if it's a girl.

As in ''Mouse''?

As in my grandmother.

Still, you say ''Minnie,''
you hear ''Mouse. ''

How about. . . .

How about ''Julia''?

Julia.

We agreed on Minnie.

We agreed we'd spend
our lives together.

Things change.
Roll with the punches.

I believe Julia's on the table.

Sorry about that.

So what have you been up to?

Not much.

I got a job.

That's great!

Why are you so tan?

I went to Aruba.

Oh, no!
You went on our honeymoon alone?

No.

See, I went with. . . .

-Now, this may hurt.
-Me?

I went with Mindy.

Mindy?

My maid of honor?

We're kind of a thing now.

You got plugs!

Careful, careful. They
haven't quite taken yet.

And you got lenses.

But you hate sticking
your finger in your eye.

Not for her.

Listen, I really
wanted to thank you.

A month ago,
I wanted to hurt you. . .

. . .more than I've ever
wanted to hurt anyone.

And I'm an orthodontist.

You know, you were right.

I thought we were happy.

We weren't.

But with Mindy. . .

. . .now I'm happy.

-Spit.
-What?

Me.

Anyway. . . .

I guess this belongs to you.

And thank you for giving it to me.

Well, thank you for giving it back.

Hello!

Oh, please!
What's wrong with Helen?

Helen Geller?

l don't think so!

It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Thank you.

No. I mean, it's not Geller.

It'll be Helen Willick?

Actually, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

Well, wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

It's my baby too.

Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

And we all know what
a challenge that is.

You two, stop it!

She gets a credit!
I'm in there too!

Not Helen Willick Bunch Geller.
I think that borders on child abuse.

Of course not!
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

He knows no one will
say all those names.

They'll end up calling her Geller.
Then he gets his way.

My way?
You think this is my way?

Of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being. . .

. . .this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.

Knock, knock!
How are we today? Any nausea?

-A little.
-Just a little.

I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

Lie back.

You know what? I'm gonna go.

I don't think I can be involved
in this particular family thing.

Oh, my God!

Look at that!

I know!

Well, isn't that amazing?

What are we supposed to see?

I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

If you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes. . .

. . .it kind of looks
like an old potato.

Then don't do that, all right?

What do you think?

Are you welling up?

You are.

-You are. You're welling up.
-I'm not.

-You're going to be an aunt.
-Oh, shut up!

Hi, Mindy!

Hi, it's Rachel.

Yeah, I'm fine.
I saw Barry today.

He told me. No, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.

I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

And, Min, you know,
if everything works out. . .

. . .and you guys end up getting
married and having kids. . .

. . .I hope they have his old
hairline and your old nose!

I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now!

Hi guys!
Hey, Pheebs!

Oh, oh, how'd it go?

Um, not so good.

He walked me to the subway and said
'We should do this again!'
Ohh. Ouch.

What?
He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?

Uh, no. Loosely translated
'We should do this again' means

'You will never see me naked'.

Since when?

Since always.
It's like dating language.

Y'know, like
'It's not you' means 'It is you'.

Or 'You're such a nice guy' means
'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics

and complaining about them to you'.

Or, or, y'know, um,
'I think we should see other people'

'Ha, ha, I already am'.

And everybody knows this?

Yeah. Cushions the blow.

Yeah, it's like when you're a kid,
and your parents put your dog to sleep,

and they tell you it
went off to live on some farm.

That's funny, that, no, because,
uh, our parents actually did,

uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.

Uh, Ross.

What? Wh- hello?
The Millners' farm in Connecticut?

The Millners, they had
this unbelievable farm,

they had horses, and,
and rabbits that he could

chase and it was- it w- .....

Oh my God, Chi Chi!

FRIENDS

"So how does it feel knowing
you're about to die?"

"Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

But you'll have to live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die."

Hey, that was really good!

Thanks! Let's keep going.

Okay.
"So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"

"I just wanna go back to my cell.
'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."

"Smoke away."

I think this is probably why
 Damone smokes in his cell alone.

What?
Relax your hand!

Not so much!

Alright, now try taking a puff.

Alright..

Okay.
No. Give it to me.

No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.

It's fine, it's fine. Look,
do you wanna get this part, or not?

Here.
Don't think of it as a cigarette..

Think of it as the thing that's
been missing from your hand.

When you're holding it, you feel right.

You feel complete.

Y'miss it?

Nah, not so much.

Alright, now we smoke.

Oh.. my.. God.

They say it's the same as the distance from

the tip of a guy's thumb
to the tip of his index finger.

That's ridiculous!

Can I use.. either thumb?

Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!

Decaf cappucino for Joey..

Coffee black..

Late...

And an iced tea.

I'm getting pretty good at this!

Yeah. Yeah, excellent.

Good for me!

Y'okay, Phoebe?

Yeah... no... I'm just... it's, I haven't worked...

It's my bank.

What did they do to you?

It's nothing, it's just... Okay.
I'm going through my mail,

and I open up their monthly, you know,
STATEMENT... Easy.

...and there's five hundred
extra dollars in my account.

Oh, Satan's minions at work again...

Yes, 'cause now I have to go
down there, and deal with them.

What are you talking about?
Keep it!

It's not mine, I didn't earn it,

if I kept it, it would be like stealing.

Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping!

Okay. Okay, let's say I bought
a really great pair of shoes.

Do you know what I'd hear,
with every step I took?

'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.'

And even if I was happy,
okay, and, and skipping...

'Not... not... mine, not... not... mine,
not... not... mine, not... not... mine'...

We're with you. We got it.

Okay. I'd... just... I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It would be like this giant karmic debt.

Chandler, what are you doing?

Hey. Whaddya doing?

Oh! Oh, God!

What is this?!

I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.

Oh, I can't believe you!
You've been so good, for three years!

And this... is my reward!

Hold on a second, alright?
Just think about what you went
through the last time you quit.

Okay, so this time I won't quit!

Ohhh! Put it out!

All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.

Oh, no! I... I can't drink this now!

Alright. I'm gonna go change,
I've got a date.

This Alan again? How's it goin'?

'S'going pretty good, y'know?
It's nice, and, we're having fun.

So when do we get to meet the guy?

Let's see, today's Monday...

Never.

Oh, come on! Come on!
No. Not after what happened with Steve.

What are you talking about?

We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..

Sorry.

Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet.
Just give me a chance to figure that out.

Well, then can we meet him?

Nope. Schhorry.

I mean, why should I let them meet him?

and within five minutes they're all over him.

I mean, they're like... coyotes,
picking off the weak members of the herd.

Listen. As someone who's seen
more than her fair share of bad beef,

I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.

I mean, they're your friends,
they're just looking out after you.

I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring
a guy home that they actually liked.

Well, you do realise the odds of that happening
are a little slimmer

if they never get to meet the guy...

Let it go, Ross.

Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.

Do you all promise?

Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!

Chandler? Do you promise to be good?

You can come in,
but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!

Hey, Pheebs.

'Dear Ms. Buffay.

Thank you for calling attention to our error.

We have credited your account
with five hundred dollars.

We're sorry for the inconvenence,
and hope you'll accept this football phone

as our free gift.'
Do you believe this?!

Now I have a thousand dollars,
and a football phone!

What bank is this?

Hey. It's him.

 Who is it?
It's Alan.

Chandler! He's here!

Okay, please be good, please.

Just remember how much you all like me.

Hi.
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!

Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow.

Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?

C'mon!

...I'll go.

Let's start with the way
he kept picking at...

no, I'm sorry,

I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.

Loved him! Yeah! He's great!

Wait a minute!

We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Yeah!

And did you notice...?
Yeah.

Know what was great?
The way his smile was kinda crooked.

Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!

...What shoe?

From the nursery rhyme.

'There was a crooked man,
Who had a crooked smile,

Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'

...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against

which all future boyfriends will be measured.

What future boyfriends?

Nono, I th... I think this could be, y'know, it.
Really!

Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his
David Hasselhof impression alone.

You know I'm gonna be
doing that at parties, right?

You know what I like most about him, though?
What?

The way he makes me feel about myself.
Yeah...

Hi... how was the game?

Well...

WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!

Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?

Alan.
He was unbelievable.

e was like that...that... that Bugs Bunny
cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions,

right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,
second base-Alan, third base-...

I mean, it...it was like,
it was like he made us into a team.

Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball..

Can I ask you guys a question?

D'you ever think that Alan is maybe... sometimes...

What?

...I dunno, a little too Alan?

Well, no. That's impossible.
You can never be too Alan.

Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness
that... that... that we adore.

I personally could have a gallon of Alan.

Hey, Lizzie.

Hey, Weird Girl.

I brought you alphabet soup.
Did you pick out the vowels?

Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y".

Uh, I also have something else for you.

Saltines?

No, but would you like a
thousand dollars and a football phone?

What?

Oh my God,

there's really money in here.
I know.

Weird Girl, what are you doing?

No, I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

No, no, I ha...
I have to give you something.

Oh, that's fine, no.

Would you like my tin-foil hat?

No. 'Cause you need that.
No, it's okay, thanks.

Please, let me do something.

Okay, alright, you buy me a soda,
and then we're even. Okay?
Okay.

Okay.
Keep the change.

Thanks, Lizzie.

Sure you don't wanna pretzel?

No, I'm fine.
See ya.

Huh!
A thumb?!

I know! I know,
I opened it up and there it was,

just floating in there,
like this tiny little hitch-hiker!

Well, maybe it's a contest,
y'know? Like, collect all five?

Does, um, anyone wanna see?

Nooo!

Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!

It's worse than the thumb!

Hey, this is so unfair!

Oh, why is it unfair?

So I have a flaw! Big deal!

Like Joey's constant
knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?

And Ross, with his over-pronouncing
every single word?

And Monica, with that snort
when she laughs?

I mean, what the hell is that thing?

I accept all those flaws,
why can't you accept me for this?

Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?

Well, I... I could live without it.

Well, is it, like, a little annoying,
or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

Oh, now, don't listen to him,
Pheebs, I think it's endearing.

Oh, "you do, do you"?

You know, there's nothing
wrong with speaking correctly.

"Indeed there isn't"...

I should really get back to work.

Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone
might get what they actually ordered.

The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.

Did you ever go out with a
guy your friends all really like?

No.

Okay... Well, I'm going out with a guy
my friends all really like.

Wait... wait... we talking
about the coyotes here?

All right, a cow got through!

Can you believe it?

...Y'know what?

I just don't feel the thing.

I mean, they feel the thing,

I don't feel the thing.

Honey... you should always feel the thing.

Listen, if that's how you feel
about the guy, Monica, dump him!

I know... it's gonna be really hard.

Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.

No, he'll be fine.
It's the other five I'm worried about.

Do you have any respect for your body?

Don't you realise what
you're-you're doing to yourself?

Hey, y'know, I have had it with
you guys and your cancer

and your emphysema and your heart disease.

The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.

Chandler? It's Alan,
he wants to speak to you.

Really? He does?

Hey, buddy, what's up!

Oh, she told you about that, huh.

Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now.

Well, it's not that big...

well, that's true...

Gee, y'know, no-one...
no-one's ever put it like that before.

Well, okay, thanks!

God, he's good.

If only he were a woman.
Yeah.

Ooh, Lambchop.

How old is that sock?

If I had a sock on my hand for
thirty years it'd be talking too.

Okay. I think it's time to
change somebody's nicotine patch.

Hey. Where's Joey?

Joey ate my last stick of gum,
so I killed him.

Do you think that was wrong?

I think he's across the hall.

Thanks.
There y'go.

Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?...
Pheebs?

Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?

Hey, I might!

Sorry...

Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me
seven thousand dollars for the thumb.

You're kidding.
Oh my God.

And on my way over here,
I stepped in gum.

...What is up with the universe?!

What's going on?

Nothing.
I just think it's nice when we're all here together.

Even nicer when everyone
gets to wear their underwear...

Uh, Joey... Oh, God! Okay...
Oh! That was Lambchop!

Please, guys, we have to talk.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...

No, I'm not.

Alright, we have to talk.

There it is!

Okay. It's-it's about Alan.

There's something that you should know.

I mean, there's really
no easy way to say this...

uh... I've decided to break up with Alan.

Is there somebody else?

No, nononono... it's just... things change.

People change.

We didn't change..

So that's it? It's over?

Just like that?

You know.. you let your guard down,
you start to really care about someone,
and I just... I...

Look, I... I could go on pretending...
Okay!

...but that wouldn't be fair to me,
it wouldn't be fair to Alan...
It wouldn't be fair to you!

Who... who wants fair?

Y'know, I just want things back.
Y'know, the way they were.

I'm sorry...

Oh, she's sorry!
I feel better!

I just can't believe this!

I mean, with the holidays coming up...
I wanted him to meet my family...

I'll meet somone else.
There'll be other Alans.

Oh, yeah! Right!

Are you guys gonna be okay?

Hey hey, we'll be fine.

We're just gonna need a little time.

I understand.

Wow.
I'm, I'm really sorry.

Yeah, I'm sorry too.

But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.

Relieved?

Yeah, well, I had a great time with you...

I just can't stand your friends.

Remember when we went to Central Park
and rented boats?

That was fun.

Yeah.
He could row like a viking.

Hi.
Mmm.

So how'd it go?

Oh, y'know..

Did he mention us?

He said he's really gonna miss you guys.

You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.

...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
No no no!

I don't care, I don't care! Game's over!

I'm weak! I've gotta smoke!
I've gotta have the smoke!

If you never smoke again
I'll give you seven thousand dollars!

Yeah, alright.

- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Phoebe.

- How did it go?
- Not so good.

He walked me home and said,
"Let's do this again."

He said, "Let's do this again."
That's good, right?

Translated, "Let's do this again"
means, "You'll never see me naked."

Since when?

Since always.
It's, like, dating language.

Like, "It's not you"
means, "It is you."

"You're nice" means, "I'll be

"We should see
other people" means:

"Ha-ha, I already am!"

Everybody knows this?

Cushions the blow.

Like your parents
putting the dog to sleep..

and saying it went to a farm.

That's funny. Because our
parents actually did..

send our dog off to live on a farm.

Ross?

Hello! The Milner's farm
in Connecticut?

The Milners had this
unbelievable farm.

They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

And it was..

Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

The One With the Thumb

How does it feel knowing
you're about to die?

Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

But you'll live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

That was really good!

Thanks. Let's keep going.

So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?

I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell I can smoke.

Smoke away!

I think this is why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

- What?
- Relax your hand.

Let your wrist go.

Not so much!

All right. Now take a puff.

Right.

- Give it to me.
- I'm not giving you a cigarette.

It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not? Here.

Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.

When you hold it,
you feel right.

You feel complete.

- You miss it?
- No, not so much.

All right. Now we smoke.

Oh, my God!

- Give me that!
- No. You've got options.

You can smoke like this:

- Chandler
- Or hold it in your mouth.

Give me the cigarette!

- You try.
- Thank you.

Okay, how's this?

Okay, that's not bad.

All right, when you're finished,
it's cool if you flick it.

All right, you keep practicing..

and I'll go put out the sofa.

I thought it was foot size.

No. It's the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb..

to the tip of his index finger.

That's ridiculous.

Can I use either thumb?

I'd rather go with the foot theory.

All right. Don't tell me.

Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

Coffee, black.

Latte.

And an iced tea.

- I'm getting good at this.
- Excellent!

Good for me!

- You okay, Phoebe?
- It's not worth

It's my bank.

- What did they do?
- It's nothing

I get my mail and
open their monthly "statement."

Easy!

And there's $500 extra in my account.

Satan's minions at work again!

Now I have to go deal with them

- What are you talking about? Keep it!
- It's not mine.

If I kept it, I'd be stealing.

But if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."

We're with you. We got it.

I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be this giant karmic debt.

Chandler, what are you doing?

What are you doing?

Oh, gross!

- What is this?
- I'm smoking!

You've been so good for three years!

And this is my reward.

Think about what you went
through when you quit.

Forget about you. Think about
what we went through!

So this time I won't quit.

- Put it out!
- I'm putting it out!

Oh, no!

I can't drink this now.

I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

With Alan again?
How's it going?

It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

When do we get to meet him?

Let's see, it's Monday..

- Never.
- Come on!

Not after what happened with Steve.

What do you mean?
We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

Sorry.

I don't know how I feel yet.
Let me figure it out.

Then can we meet him?

No.

Sorry.

Joey. Let it go.

Why should they meet him?

I bring a guy home and they're like..

coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef..

I'll tell you,
that is not such a terrible thing.

Your friends are just
looking after you.

I wish that once I'd date a guy
they liked.

You realize the odds of that
happening are slimmer..

- if they never get to meet the guy.
- I know.

- Can't I whimper a little bit?
- Whimper.

Okay, I'm done.

Let it go, Ross.

You didn't know Chi-Chi.

- Do you all promise?
- We promise.

We'll be good.

Chandler, do you promise to be good?

You can come in, but your
filter-tip buddy stays outside!

"Dear Ms. Buffay.
Thank you for calling.

We've credited you $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience..

and hope you'll accept
this football phone..

as our gift."
Do you believe it?

Now I have $ 1000
and a football phone.

What bank is this?

Okay, it's him.

- Who is it?
- Alan.

Chandler! He's here!

Do I look okay?

One more button.

Closed! How about closed?

- I didn't know.
- Yeah.

Please be good.

Remember how much you all like me?

Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

I've heard so much about
all you guys.

I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks.

Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

Who's gonna take the first shot?

Come on!

I'll go.

Let's start with how he
kept picking

I'm sorry, I can't do this.
We loved him.

We loved him!

Wait! We're talking about someone
I'm going out with?

That pimento trick!

I'll never look at an olive
the same way again.

And did you notice?

Know what was great?
His smile was crooked.

- Yes! Like the man in the shoe!
- What shoe?

From the rhyme.

There was a man
With a crooked smile

Who lived in a shoe
For a while

So I think Alan..

is the yardstick by which
future boyfriends will be measured.

Future boyfriends?

- I think this could be "it."
- Really?

I'd marry him for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

You know I'll be doing that
at parties.

- Know what I like most?
- What?

The way he makes me feel about myself.

How was the game?

Well..

We won!

Fantastic! Question.
How is that possible?

- Alan.
- He was unbelievable!

Like the cartoon where
Bugs Bunny plays every position.

It was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan..

It was like he made us into a team.

We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball.

Can I ask a question?

Do you think Alan is sometimes..

What?

I don't know. A little too "Alan"?

Oh, no. Not possible.
You can never be too "Alan."

It's his innate "Alan-ness"
that we adore.

I, personally, could have
a gallon of Alan.

- Hey, Lizzy.
- Hey, weird girl.

- I brought alphabet soup.
- Pick out the vowels?

I left in the Y's.
Because, "sometimes Y."

- And something else.
- Saltines?

No, $1000 and a football phone.

What?

Oh, my God!

- There's really money in here.
- I know.

What are you doing?

I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

- I have to give you something.
- No, you don't

- Do you want my tinfoil hat?
- No, you need that.

- It's okay. Thanks.
- Let me do something.

I'll tell you what. Buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

- Okay.
- Okay.

Keep the change.

Thanks, Lizzy.

Want a pretzel?

- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- See you.

A thumb?

I know. There it was,
just floating..

like this tiny little hitchhiker.

Maybe it's a contest.
Like "collect all five."

- Does anyone wanna see?
- No, thanks!

Don't do that. Come on!

It's worse than the thumb.

- This is so unfair.
- Why is it unfair?

So I have a flaw! Big deal!

Joey's knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying?

Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

Monica, who snorts when she laughs.
I mean, what the hell is that thing?

I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

Does the knuckle-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

I could live without it.

Is it a little annoying? Or is it like
when Phoebe chews her hair?

Don't listen to him.
I think it's endearing.

Oh, you do, do you?

There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctly.

Indeed there isn't.

I should get back to work.

Otherwise someone might
get what they ordered.

The hair comes out
and the gloves come off.

Ever go out with a guy
your friends really like?

No.

I'm going out with a guy
my friends really like.

Are we talking about the coyotes here?

All right! A cow got through.

Can you believe it?

It's just, you know what?

I just don't feel the "thing."

They feel the thing. I don't feel it.

Honey, you should always
feel the thing.

If that's how you feel about the guy,
dump him.

- It's gonna be really hard.
- He'll get over it.

No, he'll be fine. It's the other five
I'm worried about.

- Don't you respect your body?
- Don't you see what you're doing?

I've had it with your cancer,
emphysema and heart disease.

The bottom line is, smoking is cool,
and you know it.

Alan wants to speak to you.

Really? He does?

Hey, buddy! What's up?

She told you about that, huh?

Well, yeah. I have one now and then.
Well, yeah, now.

It's not that

Well, that's true.

Gee, you know, no one's ever put it
like that before.

Well, okay. Thanks.

God, he's good.

- If only he were a woman.
- Yeah.

Lamb Chop!

How old is that sock?

If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

I think it's time to change somebody's
nicotine patch.

- Where's Joey?
- Joey ate my last stick of gum..

so I killed him.

Do you think that was wrong?

- I think he's across the hall.
- Thanks.

There you go.

I'm alive with pleasure now.

Phoebe, do you want
the rest of that Pop-Tart?

Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop-Tart?

Hey, I might.

I'm sorry.

The soda people gave me $7000
for the thumb.

And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

What is up with the universe?

- What's going on?
- It's just nice when we're together.

It's nicer when everyone
gets to wear underwear.

Please, guys, we have to talk.

Wait! I'm getting a deja vu.

No, I'm not.

- We have to talk.
- There it is!

Okay, it's about Alan.

Speaking of which, tell him
we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

Before you get into that,
there's something you should know.

There's really no easy way
to say this.

I've decided to break up with Alan.

Is there somebody else?

No, it's just..

you know, things change.
People change.

We didn't change.

So that's it? It's over?

Just like that?

You let your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and..

- I can go on pretending
- Okay!

No.

That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan,
or to you.

Well, who wants fair?

I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.

- I'm sorry.
- Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

I can't believe this!

With the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

I'll meet someone.
There'll be other Alans.

Yeah, right!

- Are you guys gonna be okay?
- We'll be fine.

We're just gonna need a little time.

I understand.

- Wow.
- I'm really sorry.

Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.

- But I'm a little relieved.
- Relieved?

Yeah, well, I mean,
I had a great time with you.

I just can't stand your friends.

Remember when we went to Central Park
and rented boats?

That was fun.

He could row like a Viking.

So how'd it go?

You know.

Did he mention us?

He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

- Rough day, huh?
- You have no idea.

Come here.

- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
- No!

I don't care! I'm weak!

I've gotta have the smoke!

If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $7000.

Yeah, all right.

-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Phoebe.

How did it go?

Not so good.

He walked me home and said,
''We should do this again. ''

He said, ''We should do it again. ''
That's good, right?

Loosely translated,
''We should do this again,'' means:

''You will never see me naked. ''

Since when?

Since always.
It's, like, ''dating'' language.

Like, ''It's not you,''
means, ''It is you. ''

''You're nice,'' means, ''I'll be
dating leather-clad alcoholics. . .

. . .and complaining
about them to you. ''

''I think we should see
other people,'' means:

''Ha, ha, I already am! ''

Everybody knows this?

Cushions the blow.

Like your parents
putting the dog to sleep. . .

. . .and saying it went to
live on a farm.

That's funny. Because our
parents actually did. . .

. . .send our dog off to live on a farm.

Ross. . .?

Hello! The Milner's farm
in Connecticut?

The Milners had this
unbelievable farm.

They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

And it was. . . .

Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

The One With the Thumb

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

''How does it feel knowing
you're about to die?''

Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

But you'll live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

That was really good!

Thanks. Let's keep going.

''So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?''

I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell I can smoke.

''Smoke away! ''

I think this is probably why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

-What?
-Relax your hand.

Let your wrist go.

Not so much.

All right. Now try taking a puff.

Right.

Give it to me.

I'm not giving you a cigarette.

It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not?

All right. Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.

When you're holding it, you feel right.

You feel complete.

You miss it?

No, not so much.

All right. Now we smoke.

Oh, my God!

It's the same as the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb. . .

. . .to the tip of his index finger.

That's ridiculous.

Can I use either thumb?

All right. Don't tell me.

Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

Coffee, black.

Latte.

And an iced tea.

I'm getting good at this.

Excellent!

Good for me!

You okay, Phoebe?

It's not even worth--

It's my bank.

What did they do?

I'm going through my mail, and I
open up their monthly ''statement. ''

Easy!

And there's $500 extra in my account.

Satan's minions at work again!

Now I have to go down there
and deal with them--

What are you talking about?
Keep it!

It's not mine.

If I kept it, it would be
like stealing.

Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

Say I bought
a great pair of shoes.

Know what I'd hear
with every step I took?

''Not mine. Not mine. Not mine. ''

And even if I was happy
and skipping. . .

. . .I'd hear, ''Not-not mine.
Not-not mine. ''

We're with you. We got it.

I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be like this giant karmic debt.

Chandler, what are you doing?

What are you doing?

Oh, gross!

What is this?

I'm smoking! I'm smoking!

You've been so good for three years!

And this is my reward.

Just think about what you went
through the last time you quit.

So this time I won't quit.

All right! I'm putting it out!

Oh, no!

I can't drink this now.

I'm gonna go change.
I've got a date.

Is this Alan again?
How's it going?

It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

When do we get to meet the guy?

Let's see, today's Monday. . . .

Never!

Not after what happened with Steve.

What do you mean?

We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

Sorry.

I don't know how I feel about him.
Let me figure it out.

Then can we meet him?

Sorry.

Why should they meet him?

I bring a guy home and they're
all over him like. . .

. . .coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef. . .

. . .I'll tell you, that is not
such a terrible thing.

Your friends are just
looking out after you.

I wish that once I'd
bring a guy home they actually liked.

You realize the odds of that
happening are a little slimmer. . .

. . .if they never get to meet the guy.

Let it go, Ross.

You didn't know Chi-Chi.

Do you all promise?

Yeah, we promise.
We'll be good.

Chandler, do you promise to be good?

You can come in, but your filter
tip little buddy stays outside!

''Dear Ms. Buffay:

Thank you for calling.

We have credited your account $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience. . .

. . .and hope you'll accept
this football phone. . .

. . .as our gift. ''
Do you believe it?

Now I have $ 1 000
and a football phone.

What bank is this?

Okay, it's him.

-Who is it?
-Alan.

Chandler! He's here!

Please be good. Please?

Just remember how much
you all like me.

Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

I've heard so much about
all you guys.

I'll call you tomorrow.

Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

Who's gonna take the first shot?

Come on!

I'll go.

Let's start with the way he
kept picking at--

I'm sorry, I can't do this.

Can't do it. We loved him.

We loved him!

Wait a minute!

We're talking about someone
I'm going out with?

And did you notice?

Know what was great?
The way his smile was crooked.

Yes! Like the man in the shoe!

What shoe?

From the nursery rhyme.

''There was a crooked man
with a crooked smile. . .

. . .who lived in a shoe for a while. . . . ''

So I think Alan. . .

. . .is the yardstick against which all
future boyfriends will be measured.

What future boyfriends?

-I think this could be, you know, ''it. ''
-Really?

I'd marry him for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

You know I'll be doing that
at parties, right?

-Know what I like most about him?
-What?

The way he makes me feel about myself.

How was the game?

Well. . . .

We won!

Fantastic! One question:
How is that possible?

-Alan.
-He was unbelievable!

He was like a Bugs Bunny cartoon
where Bugs plays every position.

But instead of Bugs, it was 1 st
base, Alan. 2nd base, Alan. . . .

It was like he made us into a team.

We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball.

Can I ask you guys a question?

Do you think Alan
is maybe sometimes--

What?

I don't know. A little too ''Alan''?

Oh, no. That's not possible.
You can never be too ''Alan. ''

It's his innate ''Alan-ness''
that we adore.

I, personally, could have
a gallon of Alan.

Hey, Lizzy.

Hey, Weird Girl.

-I bought alphabet soup.

No, it's fine. You don't--

Do you want my tinfoil hat?

No, you need that.
It's okay. Thanks.

Please. Let me do something.

I'll tell you what. You buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

Keep the change.

Thanks, Lizzy.

Want a pretzel?

-No, I'm fine. Thanks.
-See you.

A thumb?

I know. I opened it
and there it was. . .

. . .floating in there, like
this tiny little hitchhiker.

Maybe it's a contest?
Like ''Collect all five. ''

Does anyone wanna see?

No, thanks!

Don't do that. Come on!

It's worse than the thumb.

This is so unfair.

Why is it unfair?

So I have a flaw! Big deal!

Joey's constant knuckle-
cracking isn't annoying?

And Ross, over-pronouncing
every word.

And Monica, who snorts
when she laughs.

I mean, what the hell
is that thing?

I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

Does the knuckle-cracking

I could live without it.

Is it like, a little annoying? Or

The hair comes out

Did you ever go out with a guy
your friends all really like?

No.

Well, I'm going out with a guy
my friends all really like.

Are we talking about the coyotes here?

All right! A cow got through.

Can you believe it?

It's just, you know what?

I just don't feel the ''thing. ''

I don't feel the thing.

Honey, you should always. . .

. . .feel the thing.

If that's how you feel about
the guy, dump him.

It's gonna be really hard.

He's a big boy.
He'll get over it.

No, he'll be fine. It's the other
five I'm worried about.

Don't you respect your body?

Don't you see what you're doing?

I've had it with you
and your cancer. . .

. . .emphysema and heart disease.

The bottom line is smoking is cool,

Really? He does?

Hey, buddy! What's up?

It's not that bad--

Well, that's true.

Gee, no one's ever put it
like that before.

Well, okay. Thanks.

God, he's good.

If only he were a woman.

Oh, Lamb Chop!

How old is that sock?

If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

I think it's time to change
somebody's nicotine patch.

Where's Joey?

Joey ate my last stick
of gum, so I killed him.

Do you think that was wrong?

I think he's across the hall.

There you go.

Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

Pheebs, do you want
the rest of that Pop Tart?

Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop Tart?

Hey, I might.

I'm sorry.

Those stupid soda people gave
me $ 7000 for the thumb.

And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

What is up with the universe?

What's going on?

Nothing. I think it's nice
when we're together.

It's even nicer when everyone
gets to wear their underwear.

Please, guys, we have to talk.

Wait, wait!
